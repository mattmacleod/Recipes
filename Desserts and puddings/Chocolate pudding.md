# Chocolate Pudding

> Not sure where this recipe came from, but I've been using it for years as an alternative to Christmas pudding for people who aren't that much of a fan. You can add some additional twists to it – orange zest and extract makes a lovely chocolate orange pudding!

## Attributes

- Servings: 8-10
- Prep time: 20 minutes
- Cooking time: 1 hour 30 minutes

## Equipment

- Large 1.7 litre pudding basin with a lid
- Food processor
- Aluminium foil

## Ingredients

### For the pudding

- 175g plain flour
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 40g cocoa powder
- 175g caster sugar
- 175g soft butter
- 60ml plain yogurt
- 3 eggs
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda

### For the sauce (optional)

- 125g milk chocolate
- 125g dark chocolate
- 250ml double cream
- 75g golden syrup
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract

## Method

1. Butter your pudding basin, and start boiling a pan of water large enough to steam the pudding in.

2. Add all of the pudding ingredients to the food processor, and mix until smooth. Take the lid off and scrape down a couple of times to make sure everything is incorporated evenly. Pour into the pudding basin, grease a small piece of foil and wrap tightly around the top of the basin, then pop the lid on.

3. Place in the boiling water and steam for about 1 hour 30 minutes. The pudding will rise almost to the top.

4. To make the sauce, place all of the sauce ingredients into a medium sized pan and place over a gentle heat to melt, stirring every now and again until melted. Remove from the heat and whisk gently until everything is smoothly combined.

5. When the pudding has cooked, remove it from the pan, remove the lid and take off the foil. Check that it's cooked through by piercing with a wooden skewer – it should come out mostly dry and not have any uncooked batter on it. Steam for another five minutes if needed. Once cooked, leave to cool for a few minutes, then cover with a plate and flip over to release the pudding.

6. Pour some hot sauce over the pudding, and serve the rest. Also goes great with ice cream.
