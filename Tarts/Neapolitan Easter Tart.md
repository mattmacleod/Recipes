- Food processor

- Ceramic baking beads

## Ingredients

### For the pastry

- 150g butter at room temperature
- 400g tipo 00 flour
- 100g golder caster sugar
- 1/2 of a lemon
- 3 large eggs

### For the filling

- 400g jar cooked wheat berries
- 120ml whole milk
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 lemon
- 250g ricotta cheese
- 5 egg yolks
- 2 egg whites
- 200g icing sugar
- 120g candied mixed peel
- 1 and 1/2 tablespoons orange blossom water
- 1 orange

## Method

1. Make the pastry by cutting the butter into blocks and place in the food processor along with the flour, sugar, and the zest of 1/2 lemon. Pulse the processor until the mixture resembled fine breadcrumbs.

2. Add the eggs and pulse the processor again until a smooth dough is formed. Wrap the dough in cling film and place in the fridge for 1 hour to chill.

3. Grease the tart tin with a little butter. Roll the pastry out to a large-enough size to line the tin, then place it in the tin, trim and save the excess pastry, then place the tin in the freezer for about half an hour.

4. Preheat the oven to 170C/fan 160C. Line the chilled tart casing with baking paper and fill with the baking beads. Pierce the pastry all over with a fork, then bake for 20 minutes until slightly browned.

5. While the base cooks, prepare the filling. Mix the cooked wheat, milk, vanilla and half a lemon's zest in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the wheat has absormed the liquid, then remove from the heat and allow to cool.

6. In a mixing bowl, mix together the egg yolks and ricotta and beat until light. Sift in the icing sugar, then add the candied peel, orange blossom water, the zest of one orange and the remaining lemon zest. Beat until combined, then stir in the wheat mixture.

7. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites into stiff peaks, then gently fold into the wheat and ricotta mixture.

8. Pout the filling into the tart case, and use the remaining pastry to create a rough criss-cross shape on top of the tart.

9. Bake for 50 minutes until golden on top.

10. Remove the tart from the oven and allow to cool completely on a wire rack. Dust the top with plenty of icing sugar and serve with whipped cream.
