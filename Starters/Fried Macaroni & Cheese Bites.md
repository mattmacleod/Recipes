# Fried Macaroni and Cheese Bites

> Deep fried mac and cheese is stupidly unhealthy, but it's also a great starter for a special occasion.

# Attributes

- Servings: 12 balls
- Prep time: 15 minutes (plus 3-4 hours chilling)
- Cooking time: 30 minutes in batches

## Ingredients

- Around 500g mac and cheese, made to your specification
- Vegetable oil as needed for frying
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 75g Panko breadcrumbs
- 2 tablespoons chopped chives

## Method

1. Place mac and cheese into the refrigerator until firm, about 3-4 hours.

2. Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep pan over a medium high heat.

3. Using a small ice cream scoop or similar, roll macaroni and cheese into 4cm-ish balls, forming about 12.

4. Working one at a time, dip balls into eggs, then dredge in Panko, pressing to coat.

5. Working in batches, add balls to the oil and cook until evenly golden and crispy, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Sprinkle with chopped chives to serve.
