# Gujarati Makai Sabji

> This is a corn-on-the-cob curry that doesn't use tomatoes, onions or cream – but cooked nuts give it a great flavour.

## Attributes

- Servings: 8
- Total time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

- 6 corn cobs
- 60g chickpea flour / gram flour / Chana dal
- 120g red-skinned, unsalted peanuts, ground to a fine powder in a food processor
- 5 tbsp sunflower oil
- 300ml full-fat greek yoghurt
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp ground turmeric
- 2 tsp chilli powder
- 2 tsp sugar
- extra lightly-crushed peanuts and chilli flakes for servoing
- juice of 1 lemon

## Method

1. Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Remove any husk from the corn, then split the cobs in half lengthwise. Add the corn to the wayer and boil for about 8 minutes or until tender. Drain and set aside.
2. Heat the oil into a large frying pan until medium hot, then add the flour. Stir vigorously to smooth out any lumps and prevent it from burning. After 3-4 minutes it will turn a reddish-brown; when this happens, turn the heat to a minimum and stir in the peanuts. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Add the yoghurt, salt, turmeric, chilli powder, sugar, and lemon juice to the pan. Mix to a thick paste, then slowly start adding 600ml of water, stirring continuously to form a smooth sauce.
5. Place the cooked corn in the pan, cover and leave to on a low heat for about 10 minutes. Transfer to individual bowls, and scatter with the extra crushed peanuts and chilli flakes.
