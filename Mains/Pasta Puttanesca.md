# Pasta Puttanesca

> This is a great way to use up some random meat. I don't know how real or genuine this is as a pasta dish really. The only reason I actually made it was when I had some spare pasta and steak over the COVID-19 lockdown, and was trying to come up with something that could use all my excessive food up.
