# Giant meatballs

> These are more like massive meatloaf balls than traditional meatballs, and I think the recipe is a tweaked Jamie Oliver one

## Attributes

- Servings: 8 meatballs
- Cooking time: 45 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 kg minced beef, 5% fat
- 2 red onions, roughly chopped
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tablespoons breadcrumbs
- 8 sprigs of fresh rosemary (about 10cm long)
- 20-30 cherry tomatoes
- 4 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped.
- olive oil

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 220C
2. Put the ontions, cumin, paprika and beef in a coof processor and pulse until thoroughly mixed.
3. Add the breadcumbs and eggs, season with salt and pepper, then pulse until combined.
4. Remove from the mixer and shape into 8 roughly round balls. Strip the leaves from the bottom inch of the rosemary sprigs (keep the removed leaves to one side), and insert one into each meatball, leaving the top sticking out.
5. Slice the tomatoes in half and spread out over a large roasting tray, then add the garlic. Roughly chop the remaining rosemary leaves and add to the trays. Drizzle over a little olive oil and toss.
6. Place a rack over each tray and lay the balls on top. The juice fromteh balls will drop down during cooking, so make sure it's positioned over the roasting tray.
7. Serve one ball per person with potatoes, polenta, or something similar, and the tomato and garlic sauce from the tray drizzled over.
