# Sesame Chicken

> This is (I think?) a Korean-style chicken recipe – the chicken is coated in a light batter and fried, then cooked in a sweet and sticky soy-based sauce. It's incredibly sweet and salty, so not one for every day – but it's delicious.

## Attributes

- Servings: 3–4 people
- Prep time: 20 minutes
- Cooking time: 20 minutes

## Equipment

- Large frying pan

## Ingredients

### For the chicken

- 500g boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 3 tablespoons cornflour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 large egg
- Black pepper to taste

### For the sauce

- 120ml soy sauce
- 120ml chicken stock
- 3 tablespoons dark brown soft sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornflour
- 2 tablespoons cider or white wine vinegar
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon powdered ginger
- 2 teaspoons sesame seeds
- 2 teasponns red chilli flakes

## Method

1. First, prepare the sauce – just combine all of the ingredients thoroughly and set aside.
2. Prepare the batter – whisk together the cornflour, salt and egg, and season with pepper. Cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces, drop into the batter, and mix well.
3. In the frying pan, heat about 1 tablespoon of oil. Place the chicken into the pan, piece by piece, making sure it makes good contact with the pan. Leave plenty of space for each piece – you will want to do this in two or three batches, adding more oil as required. Turn each piece a couple of times, until they are golden brown and cooked through.
4. When all of the chicken is cooked, add it all back to the pan, whisk the sauce to ensure it's still combined, and then pour it over the chicken.
5. Simmer on a gentle heat, stirring periodically, until the sauce has thickened. Remove from the heat and serve.
