## Ingredients

### For the seitan

- 250g vital wheat gluten
- 150g nutritional yeast flakes
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 2 teaspoons oregano
- 2 tablespoons Old Bay or onion powder
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons worcestershire sauce
- 350ml vegetable stock, and
- 1 litre vegetable stock

### For the coating

- 250g flour
- 1 tablespoon paprirka
- 2 tablespoons Old Bay or onion powder
- 1 tablespoon cayenne peppe
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs
- Sunflower oil for frying

## Method

1. In a food processorr, combine all of the seitan ingredients except for the litre of stock. Whizz with the dough hook for a minute or two until it's thoroughly kneaded, then leave to rest for five minutes.

2. Meanwhile, boil the stock in a LARGE pan (the seitan will expand a lot during cooking) and add 1 litre of hot water.

3. Break the seitan into small pieces, depending on how large you want the end product to be. 'Chicken nuggets', for example, would be about thumb-sized.

4. Drop the seitan into the boiling stock, and add the seitan pieces. Reduce the heat, cover, and leave to simmer for 30 minutes, turning once during cooking.

5. Heat the sunflower oil in a large, flat pan – deep enough to cover the seitan pieces.

5. Whisk the eggs with a little water, and combine the rest of the coating ingredients. Dip each piece of seitan in the coating, using the flour mixture, then the egg mixture, then the flour mixture again.

6. When the oil is hot, batch fry the seitan pieces, turning and required, and removing to kitchen towel when light brown and crispy.
