# Brisket chilli

> I like a good chilli made with pulled beef instead of mince.

## Attributes

- Servings: 10 people
- Prep time: 1 hour
- Cooking time: 3 hours

## Ingredients

- 2kg beef brisket, trimmed
- 2 red onions, diced
- 12 cloves garlic, finely sliced
- 3 bell peppers, de-seeded and chopped
- 4 fresh red chillies, deseeded and chopped.
- 4 tins plum tomatoes
- 2 tins beans (kidney, pinto, black…)
- 50ml olive oil
- 4-5 large dried Ancho chillies
- 2 large teaspoons cumin
- 2 large teaspoons smoked paprika
- 2 large teaspoons oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 3 tablespoons molasses
- 500ml hot coffee

## Method

1. Trim the brisket to remove all fat and skin. Cut into 1-inch pieces, against the grain.

2. Soak the dried chillies in the coffee for a few minutes to let them rehydrate.

3. Heat the olive oil in a large pan over a low heat. Add the cumin, paprika, oregano, bay leaves, and the onions. Cook until the onion has softened – about 10 minutes.

4. Slice the rehydrated chillies, and add to the onion mixture along with half of the fresh chillies, cinnamon sticks, garlic, and some salt and pepper. Stir in the coffee, the tinned tomatoes, and the molasses. Break the tomatoes up with a spoon, then add the sliced brisket and cover. Leave for about three hours, stirring occasionally. 

5. When the meat has cooked, use two forms to break it up and pull it apart. Add the peppers, then drain and add the beans. Stir, and leave uncovered for about 30 minutes.

6. Have a taste and add additional seasoning as required.
