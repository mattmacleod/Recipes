# Sausage rolls

> This is a sausage roll recipe that can be mixed up with different fillings depending on what you like. I've done it with straight-up sausagemeat filling, and with a turkey and cranberry stuffing for Christmas. I use the [flaky pastry recipe](../Misc/Flaky%20Pastry.md) for this, so you'll need that prepared in advance. The recipe below is for a great variation using sausagemeat and bacon.

## Attributes

- Servings: 12 sausage rolls
- Prep time: 20 minutes
- Cooking time: 20-25 minutes

## Ingredients

- 1 block of [flaky pastry](../Misc/Flaky%20Pastry.md), chilled
- 200g quality pork sausagemeat
- 6 slices streaky bacon, finely sliced
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped sage leaves
- 1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon milk

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 220C/fan 200C.

2. In a mixing bowl, combine the sausagemeat, bacon, onion, sage, and a good seasoning of salt and pepper.

3. On a floured surface, roll the pastry out into a rectangle about 20cm x 30cm. Slice into two portions lengthwise, so you have two rectangles of 30cm x 10cm.

4. Spread half of the sausage meat into a thin roll along the middle of one of the pastry rectangle, spreading it out evenly. Brush the beaten egg along one edge, then fold the pastry and seal it carefully, keeping the filling tight. Roll over so the seam is on the bottom and press lightly to flatten out. Repeat with the second piece of pastry.

5. Use a sharp knife to cut each roll into six or more sausage rolls, depending on the size you want. Brush all over with the beaten egg, then slice the top of each one gently (don't go all the way through the pastry!).

6. Place sausage rolls on the baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden. Remove and cool on a wire rack.
