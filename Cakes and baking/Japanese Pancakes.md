# Japanese Pancakes

> This is a recipe for large, Japanese soufleé-style pancakes. We had some of them when visiting Japan, and I eventually got around to making them myself.

## Attributes

- Servings: 4
- Prep time: 10 minutes
- Cooking time: 10 minutes

## Equipment

- 4 large food rings (3-4 inches)
- Parchment/baking paper
- Large frying pan with lid

## Ingredients

- 200g plain flour
- 2 large eggs separated into yolks and whites, with the whites chilled in the fridge
- 2 chilled egg whites
- 4 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 200 ml buttermilk (or alternatively 200ml regular milk + 1 tablespoon lemon juice)

## Method

1. Whisk together egg yolks, sugar, vanilla extract and milk/buttermilk.
2. Combine flour and baking powder, then sift into the wet ingredients while continuing to whisk. Continue until smooth.
3. Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks
4. Carefully fold the beaten wgg whites into the batter – take 1/4 of the egg whites at a time and slowly fold into the batter. Don't over-mix! You're looking to create a smooth and foamy batter.
5. Prepare the cooking rings. Cut 4 strips of parchment paper so that they can be used to line the inside of the rings, then lightly oil/grease each one with butter and place inside. Make sure there isn't any extra paper hanging over the top – you'll need to flip the rings later.
6. Heat a frying pan large enough to contain the rings over a medium heat, and grease lightly with butter or a neutral oil. Place the lined rings into the pan.
7. Fill each ring about 2/3 full of batter, then cover the pan with the lid. Leave to cook for amout 4 minutes, until the pancake has risen to the top of the ring. Keep an eye on the heat - better to cook too slowly than too quickly.
8. Carefully flip each ring over. The easiest way to do this is to get a spatular underneath and hold the ring with an oven glove, then perform the flip in one smooth movement. This will be messy if it goes wrong.
9. Cover and cook for another 4 minutes. Again, keep an eye on the pancakes – you want them to be cooked through, but not burned.
10. Remove the cooked pancakes from the frying pan and gently remove from the rings. Serve immediately.
