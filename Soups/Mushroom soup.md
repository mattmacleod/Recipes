# Mushroom soup

> This is a variation on a Jamie Oliver recipe that's really nice and simple, but tastes great.

## Attributes

- Servings: 6
- Prep time: 15 minutes
- Cooking time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

- 20g dried Porcini mushrooms
- 600g mixed mushrooms (shiitake, oyster, chestnut etc. – the more the merrier)
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
- Olive oil
- Butter
- 1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 1 handful of fresh thyme leaves
- 1 litre vegetable or chicken stock
- 150ml double cream
- 1 lemon

## Method

1. Place the porcini in a small bowl and cover with boiling water – leave to soak. In the meantime, wash the mushrooms and chop into smallish chunks.

2. Heat a large pan with a bit of olive oil and a pat of butter, then add the chopped onion, garlic and thyme. Cook for a couple of minutes until the onion starts to brown, then add the mushrooms, some salt amd pepper, and stir thoroughly. Add the porcini and the liquid they were soaking in, then cook uncovered for about 20 minutes until the liquid disappears.

3. Add the stock, bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. At this point, use a stick blender to purée the soup a little – but don't overdo it, you don't want mushy mushrooms. 

4. After the soup has cooked, add the double cream, and the zest and juice of the lemon. Serve with a swirl of cream and a sprinking of thyme on top.
