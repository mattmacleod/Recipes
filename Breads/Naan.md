# Garlic naan bread

> This is the most convincing recipe I've been able to get for making restaurant-style naan bread.

## Attributes

- Servings: 12 medium-sized naans
- Prep and rise time: 1 hour
- Cooking time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients

- 500g plain white flour
- 200g full-fat yoghurt
- 40ml warm water
- 200ml warm milk
- 1 packet (7 grams) dry, active yeast
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 250g melted butter
- 4 cloves garlic

## Method

1. Combine the sugar, yeast, and water together ans set aside for 10 minutes until foamy.
2. Combine the salt and flour together thoroughly. Mix the yoghurt an milk into the yeast mixture, then form a well in the center of the flour and pour in the mixture. Stir until a shaggy dough is formed, then turn out and knead for about 4 minutes (you can use an electric mixer to do this in about 1 minute if you prefer.) Continue until the dough comes together in a nice elastic shape.
3. Place the dough in a clean, oiled bowl and cover. Leave in a warm place to rise for about an hour, until doubled in size.
4. Form the dough into 10-12 separate pices and roll into tight balls. Flatten them out until they're about 7-8mm thick, then generously brush each one on both sides with butter.
5. Heat a heavy pan over a medium-high heat. Place each naan in the pan in turn â€“ cook on one side until large bubbles start forming on the surface (this takes about two minutes) then flip and lave for another 1-2 minutes until the other side is done. Stack them in a warm place.
6. To serve, finely chop the garlic and combine with the remaining melted butter. Spoon a little of the garlic butter mixture on to each naan and brush, making sure to get some garlic.
