- Prep time: 30 minutes + 1 hour rising time
- Cooking time: 20 minutes

## Ingredients

### For the bread

- 280g plain flour
- 180ml lukewarm milk
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 15g sugar
- 7g sachet active dry yeast
- 30g melted butter
- 1 egg yolk

### For the filling

- 50g softened butter
- 75g sugar
- 3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 3 teaspoons ground almonds

## Method

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast wiht the sugar and milk, and stir until combined. Add the egg yolk and melted butter.

2. In another, large bowl, mix the flour and salt, then pour over the milk mixture. Mix together, then start kneading until it pulls together. Shape the dough into a ball, then place into a clean, oiled bowl to rest. Leave for 1 hour in a warm place, until toughly doubled in size.

3. While rising, mix the softened butter with the sugar and cinnamon, then set to one side.

4. Preheat the oven to 200C/fan 180C. Line a large baking sheet with baking paper. On a floured surface, roll the dough to a rectangle about 45cm x 30cm.

5. Spread the cinnamon filling evenly over the top of the dough, reserving a tablespoon for later. Leave a 1-2cm area clear around the edges. Sprinke over the ground almonds, then roll the doll into a spiral tube with the filling on the inside.

6. Slice the rolled dough in half lengthwise, leaving about 1-2cm uncut at one end so that the dough forms a "V" shape. Braid the two legs together, keeping the layers exposed to the top. Pinch the ends together and wrap underneath to form a wreath shape.

7. Transfer the bread to the prepared baking sheet. Brush with the remaining cinnamon filling, then bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. For the last 10 minutes reduce the over temperature to 180C/fan 160C. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.
