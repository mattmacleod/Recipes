# Cheese and Garlic tear-and-share rolls

> This is the most amazing recipe for tear-and-share-style dinner rolls. It's inspired by a meal I had at the Kitchen Table in London; those rolls included additional beef fat instead of cheese, and were served with a caramalised onion butter, but I've found this version is great for serving with a large, hearty stew or similar.

## Attributes

- Servings: 20 rolls
- Prep time: 10 minutes, plus 2-3 hour rising time
- Cooking time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

- 100g unsalted butter, softened
- 450g strong white bread flour
- 7g sachet fast-action dried yeast
- 1 tsp golden caster sugar
- 2 tbsp polenta or cornmeal
- 1 garlic clove, grated
- 100g mozzarella, grated
- 150g cheddar, cut into 1cm cubes
- 50g Gruyere cheese, grated


## Method

1. Heat 280ml water in a saucepan for a minute until warm but not too hot to stick your finger in (don’t burn yourself!). Remove from the heat, then add 50g butter. Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and 1 tsp salt in a large bowl or a tabletop mixer. Add the warm water and beat to make a soft dough. Knead for 10 mins by hand, or 5 mins in a mixer, until the dough feels stretchy and smooth. Mix in the cheddar cubes so they're evenly distributed. Tip into a clean, oiled bowl and cover with oiled cling film. Leave to rise for 1½-2 hrs, or until doubled in size.

2. Brush a large baking tray with oil and scatter over the polenta. Knock the air out of the dough. Pinch off small pieces (about the size of a walnut), then roll each piece into a ball and put on the baking tray. Leave a little space between each dough ball.

3. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Cover the tray with oiled cling film, then prove for 30 mins-1 hr until the dough has doubled in size and the balls are touching. Mix the remaining butter with the garlic. When the rolls are ready to cook, brush the tops with the garlic butter and scatter with the mozzarella and gruyere. Bake for 25-30 mins until the dough balls are cooked through. Leave to cool for 5 mins, then serve.
