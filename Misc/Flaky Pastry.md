## Ingredients

- 110 g plain flour

1. Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl. With a grater placed over the bowl, grate the butter directly on top of the flour.

2. Using a spoon or spatula, start bringing the butter and floud together. Don't use your hands â€“ it's important that the mixture stays cold. Make sure all of the butter is coated with flour.

3. Add a tablespoon of cold water and continue mixing gently. Continue to add 1 or two more tablespoons of water until the dough starts to come come together. Add a little more moisture if needed. At the end, you should have a clean dough with no bits of loose fat or flour.

4. Wrap the dough in cling film and place in the fridge for 30 minutes. It's then ready to use in your recipe.
